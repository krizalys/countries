Krizalys Countries
==================

[Krizalys Countries][krizalys-countries] is a simple [Joomla!][joomla] component
that provides a country field which may then be used by other components. It
aims helping extension developers to get started quickly when creating forms.

The component offers a dropdown list of countries extending the `JFormField`
class provided by the Joomla! framework. It supports both Joomla! 2.5 and
Joomla! 3.0 and offers a list of 247 [ISO 3166][iso-3166] countries along with
their 2-letters code. This is an handy addition to build global networks.

The extension is licensed under the [3-Clause BSD License][bsd-3-clause].
